# 📳 alertO  
### Get alerted when it actually matters.

**alertO** is an Android app that listens for words you care about — and instantly alerts you when they appear.

It’s not just about your name.

It can be:

- **Important**
- **Exam**
- **Deadline**
- **Interview**
- **Urgent**
- Or literally **any word you choose**

When that word is detected, your phone:

- 📳 Vibrates  
- 🔔 Sends a notification  
- ⚡ Instantly grabs your attention  

No more missed moments.

## 🎯 Why alertO Exists

We’re constantly distracted.

Scrolling.  
Gaming.  
Texting.  
Multitasking.  

Meanwhile, the most important information slips past us.

**alertO flips the script.**

Instead of you checking your phone again and again —  
your phone checks for what matters to you.

## 🎓 Classroom Use Case

You’re sitting in class.  
Half listening. Half scrolling.

Professor says:

> “This part is important for the exam.”

You don’t catch it.

But your phone does.

📳 **Buzz.**

You immediately look up and focus.

Or imagine attendance:

Your name is called.  
You’re distracted.

📳 **Buzz.**

You respond instantly.

No missed attendance. No awkward explanations.

## 🧠 Focus Mode for Students

Add keywords like:

- **Important**
- **Exam**
- **Test**
- **Assignment**
- **Submission**
- **Deadline**

Whenever these words are spoken or appear on screen, you’re alerted.

You train your brain to react to **signals, not noise.**

## 🎮 While Gaming

You’re in the middle of a match.  
Headphones on. Full focus.

Someone in the room says your name.

You don’t hear it.

But your phone vibrates.

You know it’s important.

No more “I didn’t hear you!”

## 💬 In Busy Group Chats

Muted 500-message group.  
Notifications off.

But if someone types:

- Your name  
- **Urgent**  
- **Call me**  
- **Important**

📳 You get alerted immediately.

You ignore the chaos — but never miss what matters.

---

## 🚶 Texting While Walking

You’re walking on the road.  
You don’t want to stare at your screen constantly.

Set words like:

- **Now**
- **Emergency**
- **Come**
- **Call**

If they appear →  
📳 Your phone alerts you instantly.

Safer. Smarter.
